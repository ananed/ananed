I am an aspiring software developer with a passion for modern web technologies particularly JavaScript. 
Driven by curiosity and continuous improvements I am looking to contribute to the fascinating world of technology.

Growing up in a family with a strong engineering tradition, I came in touch with technology at a very early age through my oldest brothers. 
I was instantly captivated and started coding ever since. 
My long-lasting passion is nevertheless education and my dream is combining the power of technology to revolutionize the way we learn and teach.

On the side, I love sharing my knowledge and getting young children and teenagers introduced to the exciting world of technology, coding and learning. 
At the moment I am finishing my studies in Engineering and helping build the best training and coaching programme for software developers in Europe at CodeWithDragos.

In my free time, I like to jog around the city and read about psychology.
